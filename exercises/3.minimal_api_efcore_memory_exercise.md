## Minimal API Exercise: Customer Feedback Management

### Exercise Overview

In this exercise, you'll build a simple Customer Feedback Management system using .NET minimal APIs. The goal is to create endpoints that manage customer feedback entries for products or services, allowing users to submit new feedback, retrieve all feedback entries, and fetch a single feedback entry by its ID.

### Requirements

- **Endpoint Structure:**

  - Implement minimal API endpoints following the established structure.
  - Group your endpoints logically under a `/feedback` path.

- **Endpoints Needed:**

  - **Submit Feedback (POST)**: Allows clients to submit new feedback entries, each containing:

    - Customer Name
    - Email
    - Rating (1-5)
    - Comments
    - Date Submitted (auto-generated)

  - **Get All Feedback (GET)**: Retrieves all submitted feedback entries.

  - **Get Feedback by ID (GET)**: Retrieves a specific feedback entry by its unique identifier.

- **Data Management:**

  - Create a repository to store and manage feedback entries. This can be an in-memory collection or a database-backed solution.

- **Data Validation:**

  - Ensure proper validation of inputs (e.g., rating should be between 1 and 5, email format validation, etc.).

- **Response Handling:**

  - Ensure that the API responses include appropriate HTTP status codes and are structured clearly for consumers.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand and apply minimal API concepts in .NET.
- Practice endpoint routing and grouping.
- Implement basic CRUD (Create, Read) operations.
- Utilize repositories for data handling.
- Validate input data and manage proper HTTP response statuses.

### Submission

Submit a working minimal API solution with endpoints defined as described above, following the best practices learned in class.
